# Cirql documentation

This repository houses the documentation website source for [Cirql](https://github.com/StarlaneStudios/cirql), powered by [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Getting started

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Contributing

Maintaining documentation is hard, especially for a small team like ours. Contributions to our documentation are always welcome. If you see something that could be improved, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

This repository follows the same [Contributor Guide](https://github.com/StarlaneStudios/cirql/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) as the main repository.
