# What is Cirql

Cirql is a simple and lightweight ORM and query builder for <a href="https://surrealdb.com/">SurrealDB</a> with
built in model mapping and validation powered by <a href="https://github.com/colinhacks/zod">Zod</a>.
Unlike most query builders, Cirql takes a very open approach, providing you with complete control over your queries.

## Features
- 🔗 Connect to SurrealDB over stateful WebSockets or stateless requests
- 📦 Support for query batching & transactions
- ⚙️ Zod-powered schema validation of query results
- 📝 Full TypeScript support with Zod schema inference
- 💎 Write flexible queries using the Query Writer API
